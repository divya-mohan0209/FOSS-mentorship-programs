# Open Source mentorship programs

## What is this?

When I started out with my Open Source journey, I genuinely wish I had resources to help me get started earlier than I did! This project is a compilation of some awesome mentorship programs in the universe of Open Source. It is not an exhaustive compilation & is geared towards tech. However it is not limited to just technical internships & aims to be as extensive as possible via contributions.

## What this is (definitely) not!

I am not affiliated with any of these organizations & am not advertising the programs on their behalf. This is a curation based on my research & amendments/additions will be accepted, if they meet the contributing criteria. Please read the [Contributing Guide]() for more. Additionally, this list doesn't include open source fests/conferences that might host workshops/seminars. 

## Contents

- [Technical internships](technical-internships/)
- [Advocacy internships]()
- [Documentation internships](documentation-internships/)
- [STEM internships]() 
- [FAQ]()
